## 🔍 Bugs Found & Fixed

### Bug #1: Outdated Status in scores/config.py ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** Medium  
**Impact:** User experience (misleading status indicators)

**Description:**
The `scores/config.py` file had outdated status indicators for newly implemented calculators:
- PSI/PORT Score was marked as "📋 Kế hoạch" (Planned) instead of "✅ Hoàn thành" (Completed)
- Wells PE Score was marked as "📋 Kế hoạch" instead of "✅ Hoàn thành"
- NIHSS was marked as "📋 Kế hoạch" instead of "✅ Hoàn thành"

**Root Cause:**
When implementing new calculators, forgot to update the `SCORES_BY_SPECIALTY` dictionary in `scores/config.py`.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# BEFORE:
"🫁 Hô Hấp (Respiratory)": {
    "CURB-65": {"name": "CURB-65", "desc": "...", "status": "✅"},
    "PSI/PORT": {"name": "PSI/PORT Score", "desc": "...", "status": "📋"},  # ❌ WRONG
    "Wells PE": {"name": "Wells PE Score", "desc": "...", "status": "📋"},  # ❌ WRONG
    ...
},

"🧠 Thần Kinh (Neurology)": {
    "GCS": {"name": "GCS - Glasgow Coma Scale", "desc": "...", "status": "✅"},
    "NIHSS": {"name": "NIHSS - NIH Stroke Scale", "desc": "...", "status": "📋"},  # ❌ WRONG
    ...
},

# AFTER:
"🫁 Hô Hấp (Respiratory)": {
    "CURB-65": {"name": "CURB-65", "desc": "...", "status": "✅"},
    "PSI/PORT": {"name": "PSI/PORT Score", "desc": "...", "status": "✅"},  # ✅ FIXED
    "Wells PE": {"name": "Wells PE Score", "desc": "...", "status": "✅"},  # ✅ FIXED
    ...
},

"🧠 Thần Kinh (Neurology)": {
    "GCS": {"name": "GCS - Glasgow Coma Scale", "desc": "...", "status": "✅"},
    "NIHSS": {"name": "NIHSS - NIH Stroke Scale", "desc": "...", "status": "✅"},  # ✅ FIXED
    ...
},
```

**Testing:**
- [x] Verified status icons display correctly in UI
- [x] Checked sidebar legend matches
- [ ] User to verify in browser

**Files Changed:**
- `scores/config.py` (lines 28-29, 36)

### Bug #2: Missing Calculators in ALL_CALCULATORS Registry ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** Critical  
**Impact:** Search, Favorites, Recently Used features non-functional for new calculators

**Description:**
The `ALL_CALCULATORS` dictionary in `app.py` was missing entries for:
- PSI/PORT Score (id: "psi_port")
- Wells PE Score (id: "wells_pe")
- NIHSS (id: "nihss")

This meant:
1. ❌ Global search couldn't find these calculators
2. ❌ Favorites system couldn't add them
3. ❌ Recently Used wouldn't track them
4. ❌ System stats showed incorrect total count

**Root Cause:**
The `ALL_CALCULATORS` registry in `app.py` was not updated when new calculator files were created.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# BEFORE:
ALL_CALCULATORS = {
    ...
    # Scores - Respiratory
    "curb65": {"name": "CURB-65", "category": "Hô Hấp", "icon": "🫁", "page": "Scores"},
    # ❌ MISSING: psi_port, wells_pe
    
    # Scores - Neurology
    "gcs": {"name": "GCS", "category": "Thần Kinh", "icon": "🧠", "page": "Scores"},
    # ❌ MISSING: nihss
    ...
}

# AFTER:
ALL_CALCULATORS = {
    ...
    # Scores - Respiratory
    "curb65": {"name": "CURB-65", "category": "Hô Hấp", "icon": "🫁", "page": "Scores"},
    "psi_port": {"name": "PSI/PORT", "category": "Hô Hấp", "icon": "🫁", "page": "Scores"},  # ✅ ADDED
    "wells_pe": {"name": "Wells PE", "category": "Hô Hấp", "icon": "🫁", "page": "Scores"},  # ✅ ADDED
    
    # Scores - Neurology
    "gcs": {"name": "GCS", "category": "Thần Kinh", "icon": "🧠", "page": "Scores"},
    "nihss": {"name": "NIHSS", "category": "Thần Kinh", "icon": "🧠", "page": "Scores"},  # ✅ ADDED
    ...
}
```

**Testing:**
- [x] Total count now = 37 (was 34)
- [ ] User to test search for "PSI", "Wells", "NIHSS"
- [ ] User to test adding to favorites
- [ ] User to verify Recently Used tracking

**Files Changed:**
- `app.py` (lines 54-59)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **User Testing** (URGENT):
   - Open `TEST_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Follow step-by-step testing guide
   - Report any additional bugs

2. **Deployment:**
   - Changes auto-deploy to Streamlit Cloud from GitHub
   - Monitor for runtime errors
   - Test on mobile devices

3. **Future Prevention:**
   - Create pre-commit hook to verify ALL_CALCULATORS sync
   - Add unit tests for config validation
   - Document "Adding New Calculator" checklist in ARCHITECTURE.md

---

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **Configuration Sync:** When adding new calculators, MUST update:
   - [ ] Individual calculator file (e.g., `scores/respiratory/psi_port.py`)
   - [ ] Specialty `__init__.py` (e.g., `scores/respiratory/__init__.py`)
   - [ ] `scores/config.py` (SCORES_BY_SPECIALTY)
   - [ ] `app.py` (ALL_CALCULATORS) ⚠️ **THIS WAS MISSED**

2. **Testing:** Need automated tests to catch config mismatches

3. **Documentation:** Should add "New Calculator Checklist" to prevent this
